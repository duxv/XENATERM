# XENATERM

<p>
XENATERM is a fork of XENA that replaces the web interface<br>
with a terminal one, clients that work with XENA do not work<br>
with XENATERM, therefore it also comes with some already built<br>
clients. It is licensed under the MIT license.<br>
Any type of contribution is welcome.<br>
